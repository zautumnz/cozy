# Testing
# Currently broken due to scope mutation bug;
# tests work, but because there's no parent-scope counter,
# no test reporter will know what tests failed

# Simple assert
util.assert(1 + 1 == 2, "math doesn't work")

# TAP-producting test suites
let x = fn (a) { a }

core.test("test suite", fn (t) {
    t(1 + 1 == 2, "one plus one is two")
})

core.test("second suite", fn (t) {
    t(x(3) == 2, "three does not equal two")
    t("a" + "b" == "ab", "a + b == ab")
})
